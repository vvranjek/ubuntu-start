This is the default zonColor icon theme. This main icon theme
contains common icons used by its variant icon themes that inherit
icons from this theme.

.

To enable/activate this theme (if already installed):
=====================================================
Run "enable-icon-theme.sh" script file included in this folder,
either by double-clicking it in Nautilus (file manager) window,
or by executing it in Terminal window.
The script supports Unity/GNOME/Cinnamon/MATE/Xfce session.

Alternatively, use a theme changer utility (e.g. GNOME Tweak Tool)
or a built-in appearance settings app (if available).

.

To install (if not already):
============================
Run "enable-icon-theme.sh" script file included in this folder.
The script will check whether this icon theme installed or not,
and will automatically install when needed into "/home/$USER/.icons".
Alternatively, you can install it manually by copying this folder
into the icons folder.

.

CURSOR THEME
============
About the cursor theme, it's not completed yet, but you can use them.
Or test them. :)

FYI, In Linux Mint, custom cursor theme works perfectly, but not
in latest versions of Ubuntu. See a bug report in Launchpad
(it's Ubuntu bug I believe, not gnome-tweak-tool):
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-tweak-tool/+bug/974243

.

NOTES
=====
You may need to set file permission to the script to allow
executing it as program.
* To set file permission in Nautilus file manager:
    Right-click on the file ==> Properties ==> Permissions ==>
    Execute ==> Check "Allow executing file as program" option.
  You may also need to change Nautilus (Files) preference to be able
  to run executable text files:
    Open Nautilus (Files) Preferences window ==> Behavior ==>
    Executable Text Files: Select "Ask each time".
* To mark the script file as executable via Terminal:
  Navigate to this folder, and then run this command:
  "chmod +x *.sh" (without quotes)
